        // - If number is dividable by 3 then "Pepsi" is preferred
        // - If number is dividable by 5 then "Coke" is preferred
        // - If number is dividable by 3 and 5 then "Dr. Pepper" is preferred
        // - If no preferred brand is found, return empty string.
        // - Zero or negative input is not allowed.

        //Check Unit tests project for possible tips. There might be also need to improve tests.
